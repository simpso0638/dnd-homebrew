        <description>
            <p>An elegant looking ribbon/bow made of mahogany with a very thin strip of emerald running down the length of the material.
			When you hit an enemy, you deal the damage you normally would and that target's blood is marked. As an action, you may speak the command word and 
			drain the life from targets you have hit previously. Each target who's blood is marked must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, 
			taking 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. You heal for half of the necrotic damage dealt.</p>
